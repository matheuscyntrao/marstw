As a MarsAir Sales Director (Mark)
I want potential customers to be able to search for flights to Mars
So that they see what trips are available

Acceptance criteria
There should be ‘departure’ and ‘return’ fields on a search form.
Flights leave every six months, in July and December, both ways.
Trips for the next two years should be searchable.
If there are seats, display “Seats available! Call 0800 MARSAIR to book!”
If there are no seats, display “Sorry, there are no more seats available.”
